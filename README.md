 **This is a simplified/refactored version of the DeepTexturesTensorflow repository that implements a texture model that dynamically changes the feature set<i>(WIP)</i> to optimise the score.**
 
 + It feautres the demo application that was used to determine the optimum extended layer set, from which the feature set is calculated.
 
 + It is highly adaptable&configurable to almost any method and features dynamically updating the user (the user determines the print/image save interval) and the feature set (the user determines the updating interval)

### TODO:
 +   Add comments to the **Update(), UpdateTex()** functions
 +   Clean up
 +   Optimise method to avoid local minimum
